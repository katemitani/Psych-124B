# History
Amazon.com is the leading e-retailer in the United States that allows users to purchase and browse for a wide variety of items from the comfort of their homes. Amazon.com provides a platform for approximately 9.7 million sellers worldwide, ranging in product categories from technology and clothing to groceries/produce. Amazon is known for its free and fast shipping policies, as well as high quality customer service. It is easily accessible by a mobile app and online website address. 
According to a [Medium.com article](https://medium.com/@the_manifest/amazons-user-experience-a-case-study-fb567f79b51f) highlighting an Amazon user experience case study, Amazon.com is regarded as the most appealing interface to almost all generations of users. Despite complaints about outdated design and cluttered interfaces by many users on discussion sites such as Reddit and Twitter, for the most part Amazon has stood by the phrase, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Their consistency in website format has appealed primarily to older generations, allowing for easy usability with little change. The main interface changes have been in regard to the search and menu bar, with improvements to the color schemes, readability, and linear browsing format. However, after personal interaction with the site and comparisons to some of the shopping sites we frequently visit ourselves, we identified similar concerns regarding the interface design. For example, we find that the home page can be overstimulating with a variety of recommendations and text.
Thus, this project is designed to discover any worthwhile additions rather than drastic changes to the user interface of Amazon.com in order to provide higher quality usability and efficiency. We intend to address the usability factors as well as aesthetics of the search page through a redesign process. This process will be carried out through a series of interviews.

# Objectives, Measures, and Scope
An interview is a common technique that is used to conduct user research. It involves conversation guided by researchers to collect information about a particular subject from interviewees. In this study, we will conduct interviews with participants on their opinions and experiences with Amazon.

This activity has four main objectives:
> - To learn more about the users’ goals when shopping on Amazon
> - To learn more about the users’ needs when shopping on Amazon
> - To learn more about how users use or would use Amazon, where and when
> - To learn more about how Amazon fits or would fit into the users’ life and daily activities

Research Questions:
> - What is the users’ ultimate goal in shopping on Amazon?
> - What features of Amazon do users find the most useful? How do they use these features?
> - What kind of products do users shop for on Amazon?
> - What are some problems or complaints that users have when shopping on Amazon?
> - When, or under which circumstances, do users use Amazon to do online shopping?
> - What are users’ frequencies of doing Amazon shopping? What changes to Amazon can make them use it more often?

The following information will be collected:
> - Demographic information of every participant (e.g., age, gender)
> - Overall opinions towards Amazon
> - Users’ preference among other competing e-commerce platforms and reasons behind it
> - Frequencies of using Amazon
> - Reasons for using Amazon (i.e. what users shop for)
> - Problems users encountered while using Amazon

# Methods
## Procedure
Five interviews will be conducted independently via Zoom (and screen sharing function) during Week 8 of Winter Quarter 2022. The interviewer will ask the participant questions from a list of predetermined questions. The participants will be encouraged to answer each question honestly and as detailed as possible. 
Topics will include:
- User’s experience interacting with Amazon.com
- General shopping habits
- Difficulties or frustrations with the website
- Thoughts on certain features such as sorting functions, sharing/checkout processes, and homepage layouts

## Participants
Participants must meet the following criteria in order to participate:
- Be a UCLA student currently enrolled in Psych 124B, a course in user experience fundamentals
- Be fairly familiar with the Amazon.com website, as well as have experience shopping and checking out

## Recruitment and Incentives
A study advertisement will be posted on the class website to attract and recruit participants. Each of the participants will be interviewed by members of the research team, and a total of five participants will be scheduled.  

Participants will receive partial course credits that help their final grade for the user research class they are enrolled in by participating in this study.

## Responsibilities and Proposed Schedule
The user research team is committed to providing the following:
- User researchers Kate Mitani, Elana Koo, Emily Gao, Madison Benson, and Qiwen Jin to conduct the study, recruit participants, and analyze results
- Detailed study proposal and protocol 
- Data collection (interviews and cognitive walkthroughs) and analysis
- Summary report with recommendations

The project start date is Sunday 2/13/22, Week 7 of UCLA's spring quarter. In Week 8, we will finish conducting interiews with five participants. In Week 9, we plan to analyze the results, identify key product qualities that meet users' goals, and then develp an initial product prototype. We will test our product prototype in Week 10, and use the information gathered from this testing activity to update our initial documents in Finals Week. The detailed proposed schedule is below.
