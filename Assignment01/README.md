# Summary
## Anticipated User Population
The anticipated user population will be anyone who has reliable internet access and is interested in online shopping. In addition, users who have busy schedules, high workload, lack of efficient transportation, and far commute times are likely more dependent on online shopping with quick and free delivery. Studies have found that 81% of the Amazon Prime demographic (as of June 2020) consisted of ages 18-34 ([Statista.com, 2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/304940/amazon-prime-us-age-distribution/)). The user population may be segmented by age based on the types of products they may be most interested in. For example, college-aged shoppers may be more interested in textbooks or technology products, while new parents may be more interested in baby products or home appliances. However, for the purposes of our interviews and product development, we are focusing on the college-aged cohort that shops online.  

## Anticipated Average User
According to an [independent study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2018/01/19/how-often-do-prime-members-buy-from-amazon/109596624/) by Feedvisor (conducted on a population of 1,500 Amazon users), 85% of Prime members browse Amazon.com at least once a week, and 45% make a purchase at least once a week. Based on the marketing and advertising of the purpose of Amazon Prime, we infer that, rather than window shopping/browsing, users are often looking for a specific product or products with the influence of fast and free shipping. Many [sources](https://www.sellbrite.com/blog/amazon-product-categories/) have reported the top selling product categories to be technology, games/toys, books, clothing/beauty, and home/kitchen (in order from highest to lowest selling). In terms of convenience, users likely prefer Amazon compared to brick and mortar shopping due to the ease of browsing and ordering from any location, but primarily from the comfort of their own homes. The fast and free shipping allows for products to arrive in 1-2 days which is also a high selling point.  

Based on the research shown above, we created our persona Jessica, a female college student, based on these statistics and inferences. She shares her student Prime account with her family, purchases goods for her less tech-savvy parents, and buys a variety of goods from technology, to textbooks, to household and family products. Her hobbies include going to the beach and playing soccer.

## Planned Research Activity
The planned research activity includes conducting five interviews with Amazon’s users. Our sample pool consists of University of California, Los Angeles students enrolled in an introductory user experience class. The questions in the interviews will address the research questions of the research protocol as well as five additional topics including general usage, functionality, competitors, reviews, and potential improvements. The goal of these interviews is to investigate how real-life users interact with the product and to develop an improved user interface and experience for future users of Amazon.  

## Study Goals
This study will help us understand users’ goals and needs when using the online shopping platform Amazon. We will gain a deeper understanding of why, when, and how the users shop on Amazon. Furthermore, the study will give us insight on which aspects of our product are working for users and which aspects need to be improved upon. Moreover, these improvements will be addressed by the creation of our prototype.  

# Persona
Name
> Jessica <br/>

Age
> 21  

Income
> 10k/year from her internship/work study. She relies on her parents for tuition, rent, and extra spending money. Additionally, she receives around $15k in financial aid from UCLA.  

Occupation
> full-time student at UCLA, studying economics

Location
> Westwood, CA, in the apartments off campus near UCLA--about an 8 minute walk from campus. She lives with 3 housemates in a 2 bed/2 bath apartment.  

Expereince with Amazon
> - Her parents have an Amazon Prime Account that they have been using ever since Jessica was in 6th grade. Once Jessica became older--around 15 years old--she started making purchases on their account for small items like phone cases, screen protectors, hair accessories, and gifts for friends. It was easy for her to send gifts like books and toys to extended family who live far away through Amazon because she could have her purchase directly mailed to their homes.
> - She’s been using Amazon ever since, for approximately 6 years. When she started at UCLA, her family canceled their Amazon Prime subscription, and she signed up for one instead, because she qualified for the student discount, which was a 6-month free trial with half price Prime for the duration of college. 
> - As the oldest child of her family, she is the older tech savvy individual, and she helps her parents order technology items and household goods that they need these days. She uses Amazon 1-3 times a month to buy a variety of goods from technology to textbooks to household supplies to feminine products. She also uses Amazon Prime Video and has considered starting to use Amazon Fresh for her groceries. 
> - She uses Amazon when she has a specific type of product in mind that she’s looking for. She directly searches by keyword in the search bar. For example, she might type in “iPhone charger” when she is looking to replace or buy a new phone charger. However, she doesn’t usually have an idea of exactly which product she wants to buy, and adds roughly 3-5 different options to cart before she chooses a single one to buy. 
> - After buying the same product a couple times, for products like feminine products or dish soap, she looks through the “Buy Again” tab to quickly reorder them, rather than going through the entire search process again. For those products she reorders often, she uses one-click purchasing because she is confident in what she is looking for. However, she does not use subscription purchasing for these products because she doesn't know how often she needs to repurchase the products. 

Hobbies/Interests
> Her hobbies include going to the beach, playing soccer, and watching trashy rom coms with her friends. She recently binged the new season of You and eagerly awaits every week’s episode of Euphoria.  

Goals/Tasks
> Her goals of using Amazon vary every time she uses the site. There are two main buckets of goals: buying something new or managing a current/past order. Managing a current/past order may include canceling or returning an order.  

> **To buy something new, the tasks include**:
> 1. Knowing what she needs to buy
> 2. Going to the Amazon site
> 3. Typing in keywords for what she is looking for
> 4. Scrolling through the search results
> 5. Clicking on a couple options that seem to match what she is looking for
> 6. Reading reviews for the option that looks most appealing
> 7. Adding the best option to cart
> 8. Checking out immediately 

> If she decides almost immediately that she doesn't want the item, she then goes to "Your Orders" and decides to cancel it. But usually, she waits until it is shipped and received to decide whether she wants to keep it or not. 

> **To return an item, the tasks include**: 
> 1. Going to “Your Orders”
> 2. Under the specific order, clicking “Return or replace items” and following the ensuing workflow to confirm the return
> 3. Prepare for return by repackaging the product
> 4. Takes the order to the nearest Amazon return drop-off, which is the Westwood Whole Foods on Gayley

Relevant Relationships
> Her main relationships are her parents and her younger sister and brother. Her younger sister is 18, and her younger brother is 15. She helps her parents order household supplies, and her siblings have started using her account to make their own purchases. After her sister starts college, and Jessica graduates, her family will switch to her sister’s Amazon Prime, and again with her younger brother beyond that. She also buys gifts to be delivered to extended family who live far away.

Expectations
> Her main expectation is that she will receive the goods she purchased in 1-2 days. The biggest pros of using Amazon is how quick she will receive her order, as well as free shipping. Despite being pretty reliable, there is always the lingering fear that the product she buys will not meet what she’s looking for. However, because shipping and returns are free and fast, she is not too concerned if she buys the wrong thing.
